  <p><strong>I think starting a rocket company is an unsual thing to do and pretty risky.</strong></P>
  but I'm a big believer in us becoming a space faring civilization.<br>
  I'm a big beleiver in ~ 저는 굳게 믿습니다.<br>
  <br>
  *space-faring - 우주여행의<br>
  *civilization - 문명<br>
  <br>
  and ultimately extending life beyond Earth.<br>
  when I was in college,
  you know I tried to think<br>
  <br>

  what are the really big problems that face the world?<br>
  that would most affect the future of humanity</P>

  <P>the three that I thought were the most important were the internet
  transition to a sustainable energe econmy
  and the third was space explornation
  space exploration. (스페이스 엑스플로뤠이션)- 우주탐사
  n particular, becoming and making life multi-planerarian
  you know there are American heroes who don't like this idea
  they have both testified against commercial spaceflight in that way that you are developing it.
  and I wonder what you think of that?
  I was very sad to see that.
  because those guys are yeah...
  you know those guys are heroes of mone.
  sp it's really tough.</P>

  <P>I wish they would come and visit and see the hard work that we're doing here.
  and I think that would change their mind
  they inspired you to do this. didn't they?
  and to see them casting stone in your direction.
  yeah, it's difficult
  did you expect them to cheer you on?</P>

  <P>
  I am hoping they would
  what are you trying to prove to them?
  what I am trying to do is to make a significant difference in space flight.
  * make a significant difference in something - ~~에 대한 현격한 차이(변화)</P>


  <P>
  and help make spcase flight accessible to almost anyone.
  and make almost anyone accessible to space flight.
  a Space X rocket exploding on the lauynch pad Thursday.
  the massive fireball swallowing it whole in a matter of seconds.
  a series of  explosions and massive plumes of think billowing smoke.

  One of the most difficult choices I have ever faced in life was in 2008.
  I think I had mabye 30 milion dollars left or 40 million dollars left in 2008.
  I had two choices.</P>



  <P>
  I could put it all into one company and them the other company would definitely die.
  and split it between the two companies.
  but if I split it between two companies then both might die.
  so which one am I gonna let one starve to death.
  I couldn't ruin myself to do it.
  so I split the money between the two.
  fortunately they both came through.
  come through - (피해보부터)복구하다. 살아남다. 회복하다./훌륭히 해내다.완수해내다./살아남다.survive
  </P>


  <P>
  what was your biggest failure and how did it changfe you?
  well there's a ton of failures along the way.
  *along the way- 도중에
  that's for sure.
  as I sad for Spacex
  the first 3 launches failed and we were just barely able to scrape together
  *barely could - 간신히 ~~할 수 있었다.
  *scrape something together(스크뤠잎 투게덜)- ~~을 간신히 긁어모으다.
  enough parts and moeny to do the fourth launch.
  *발사를 하다. do the launch.
  if that fourth launch had failed, we would have been dead.
  so multiple failures in that derection or along the way.
  I tried to very hard to get the right expertise for Space-X
  </P>


  <P>
  I tried hard to find a great chief engineer for the rocket.
  but the good chief Engineers wouldn't join
  and the bad one(engineers) will...
  there's no point in hiring them
  *there's no point in - ~할 필요가 없었죠. ~할 의미가 없었죠. ~해봤자 의미가 없었죠.
  so I ende up being chief engineer of the rocket.
  If I could've found somebody better.
  *if I could have pp, (가정법 과거 완료) 만약 (과거에) ~~했었더라면, ~~했을 텐데+would have pp.
  then we would have mabye had less than 3 failures.
  that 3 failures in a row, did you think "I need to pack this in"?
  * I pack something in - 뭔가를 포기하다.
  </P>

  <P>
  so many people tried to talk me out of starting the right company
  one good friend of mine collected a whole series of vedeos of rockets blowing up.
  and made me whatch those and he just didn't want me to lose all my money.
  we are doing these things that seems unlikely to succeed.
  *be unlikely to succeed - 성공할 것 같지 않은
  and we've been fortunate and at least thus far they have succeeded it.
